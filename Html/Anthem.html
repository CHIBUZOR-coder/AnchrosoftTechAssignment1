            Nigeria, we hail thee
            Our own dear native land
            Though tribes and tongues may differ
            In brotherhood, we stand
            Nigerians all, are proud to serve
            Our sovereign Motherland.

            Our flag shall be a symbol
            That truth and justice reign
            In peace or battle, honourâ€™d,
            And this we count as gain,
            To hand on to our children
            A banner without stain.

            O God of all creation
            Grant this our one request.
            Help us to build a nation
            Where no man is oppressed
            And so with peace and plenty
            Nigeria may be blessed.
